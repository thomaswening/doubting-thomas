# C++

- [Static libraries, shared libraries and the C++ ABI](abi-and-shared-libraries.md): why C++ types can't safely cross a DLL boundary and C functions can.
- [Header-only libraries](header-only-libraries.md): shipping code as headers compiled by the user, `inline` and the one-definition rule.
- [Copy and move](copy-and-move.md): C++ objects as values, copy and move constructors, `std::move`, and the rules of zero and five.
- [Sanitizers and undefined behaviour](sanitizers.md): run-time checks (ASan, UBSan, TSan) that turn silent memory and arithmetic errors into reports.
- [RAII and ownership](raii-and-ownership.md): every resource has one owner whose destructor frees it, so code avoids raw `new` and `delete`.
- [Static analysis for C++](static-analysis.md): compiler warnings, clang-tidy and IDE plugins such as SonarQube for IDE.
- [Initialisation forms](initialisation-forms.md): `=`, `( )` and `{ }`, narrowing, zero-initialisation and the `std::vector{3}` trap.
